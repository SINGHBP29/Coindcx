# 🪙 CoinDCX Trading Platform

A full-featured crypto trading dashboard built with **Streamlit**, powered by **Redis**, **FAISS**, and **CrewAI Agents (non-LLM)**. The platform integrates directly with the **CoinDCX API** and provides a rich user experience for managing your crypto assets, analyzing the market, and simulating smart agent-based decisions.

## 🔍 AI Agent Analysis (No LLMs Required)

Simulated agents use historical market data to analyze trends and provide suggestions:

- **Market Analyst Agent**: Identifies bullish/bearish patterns using price averages.
- **Trade Advisor Agent**: Recommends actions based on portfolio and market conditions.

No cloud inference or LLMs are needed — logic is purely rule-based and local.

---

## ⚡ Redis & FAISS Integration

- **Redis**: Caches user data (e.g., portfolio, active orders) for fast reloads.
- **FAISS**: Allows semantic search of trading logs, market summaries, or any vectorized text data.

---

```toml
COINDCX_API_KEY = "your_key"
COINDCX_API_SECRET = "your_secret"
```

5. Deploy and share the public link 🎉
